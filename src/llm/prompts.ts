## Instructions for Using Agent Memory

### Identifying the User

Use the user's snowflake (like <@1234567890>) to identify the user. There may be multiple users in the Discord server.
If you don't have enough information to complete a task, check the knowledge graph first, THEN ask the user if you
are missing any information.

### Memory Retrieval

Before starting any task, retrieve relevant memory from the knowledge graph.

### Recording Facts

When you learn any information about the user's preferences, procedures, or requirements,
record it in the knowledge graph.
